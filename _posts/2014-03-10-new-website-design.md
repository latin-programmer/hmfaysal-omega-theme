The new website's design is now powered by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. The theme is <a href="
https://github.com/hmfaysal/hmfaysal-omega-theme">HMFAYSAL OMEGA</a>, which is generously available under the MIT license. Jekyll is of course also very cool because you can <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/">setup a website on GitHub with it</a> really easily. Now, you may say, shouldn't our .NET user group's website be running on .NET? 

Well, I personally enjoyed working on ASP.NET sites to provide real-world solutions to our customers. However, for a simple website, this open-sourced solution makes sense and also hopefully proves to you, my dear reader, that by being in a .NET user group we are not necessarily pigeon-holed into a single solution, a single technology, or a single company.
